# cma-scraper

Creating a function to search the Cleveland Museum of Art collections (https://www.clevelandart.org/art/collection/search) and return a data frame with the author, title, accession number, and url of the object page. Additionally, the scraper saves the data frame as a CSV file based on the search term(s) entered.

cma-scraper.py is set up to be executed in a terminal (provided your Python environment has the required libraries already installed). Running the program will generate a prompt to enter your search term or terms; the truncated results are printed to your terminal and the CSV file is saved to your current working directory.
